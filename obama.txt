Who is going to be there?
President Obama and the first lady will accompany Mr Trump in a motorcade to the US Capitol for the official ceremony, where they will be joined by members of Congress, politicians as well as supporters.
Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in November's election, are expected to attend.
George W Bush and his wife, Laura, as well as Jimmy Carter have also confirmed they will attend the ceremony.
George HW Bush, who was in hospital for respiratory problems, wrote a letter to Mr Trump wishing him well and apologising for missing the event due to health concerns.
An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people are expected to flood the nation's capital on Friday for the inauguration, but it is unclear whether they will be there in celebration or protest, officials said.
President Barack Obama drew an estimated 1.8 million people to Washington when he took office eight years ago.
